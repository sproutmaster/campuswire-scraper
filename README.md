   1. Login to campuswire and open dev tools (F12)
   2. Go to the class that you want to get data from and click on any post in that class
   3. In the Network tab, enable filter to show only Fetch/XHR requests. This is not necessary but useful
   4. If you now refresh the page, you should see a bunch of requests that campuswire makes to get data
   5. Find the request having the url: `https://campuswire.com/courses/<group_id>/posts` or having name `posts?number=<n>`

   7. Paste the clipboard content into `curl.txt`

2. Run the script
```bash
py main.py
```
